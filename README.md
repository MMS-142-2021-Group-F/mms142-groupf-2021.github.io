# What is an online booking system and how does it work

An online booking system allows customers to appoint or reserve a service conveniently through digital platforms where they can browse the amenities and features of a service and pay in advance by online transfer. This process ensures a quick and secure way for clients to get the best service they need. It is also efficient for businesses as its system “updates all changes in information and schedule and reflects them in real-time so that both you and your customers see it” (Maslovska, 2018) while keeping necessary information private with security keys.

The most common services that utilize this system are property/room rentals, such as staycations and private resorts, and transportation services. This type of system then is used mostly by travelers and tourists as it is accessible, time-saving, and provides a smooth and easy transaction. A software platform for such usually has multiple listings posted so customers can check out the property/service, along with the price. Further, clients can determine how great or unsatisfactory the service has accommodated past customers through posted reviews, allowing them to choose and book excellent services of their choice. 

To put it briefly, Maslovska (2018) summarizes the online booking system as a modern and effortless booking process convenient for traveling and even in boosting sales with everything done digitally.
