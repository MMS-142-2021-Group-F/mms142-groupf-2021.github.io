# What is Disruptive Technology?

Disruptive Technology shakes up the current market and paves the path for innovation. It becomes the impetus to the ever-growing market, changing up how the market usually operates by introducing new systems and business models. It then leads to Disruptive Innovation, which is a dynamic that evolves and changes the state of technological affairs for a specific point in time due to the impact of Disruptive Technology in the trading industry (Wardynski, 2019). Companies affected by this impact would have no choice but to compete for profits as most Disruptive Technologies tend to be more convenient than the norm. However, there is also a positive effect Disruptive Technology and Disruptive Innovation have in the market. According to McKelvey (2020), it attracts new customers into the industries. More often than not, existing customers would hesitate to support a Disruptive Technology unless the price has been driven high enough to feel a semblance of comfort for they think low prices equate to low-quality products. The possibility of the market value being brought down at some point gets overshadowed by market expansion and innovation that continues to be of help for the betterment of society. Disruptive Technology may have its fair share of risks, but it is essential in the grand scheme of business strategy.

# What is an online booking system and how does it work

An online booking system allows customers to appoint or reserve a service conveniently through digital platforms where they can browse the amenities and features of a service and pay in advance by online transfer. This process ensures a quick and secure way for clients to get the best service they need. It is also efficient for businesses as its system “updates all changes in information and schedule and reflects them in real-time so that both you and your customers see it” (Maslovska, 2018) while keeping necessary information private with security keys.

The most common services that utilize this system are property/room rentals, such as staycations and private resorts, and transportation services. This type of system then is used mostly by travelers and tourists as it is accessible, time-saving, and provides a smooth and easy transaction. A software platform for such usually has multiple listings posted so customers can check out the property/service, along with the price. Further, clients can determine how great or unsatisfactory the service has accommodated past customers through posted reviews, allowing them to choose and book excellent services of their choice. 

Online booking and reservation systems can be integrated or embedded into your website or social media pages without having to undergo the installation of the application. Customers can just click the link and they will automatically be routed to the website to book their reservation. Online payment processes are also considered safe and secure, including transaction details and customer data because they are securely stored in a cloud content management system protected by encryption and SSL security protocol, accessible only through login and password, and today with the added security you will be required to enter your One-time-password(OTP) sent to your mobile number. The process is not only easy but also hassle-free because it will only take a few minutes to complete and in the comfort of your home, office, or wherever you may be.

Also, if you need to repeat your booking, your data is safely stored and recorded for any changes or updates of your information. You will also be able to track your booking and be notified through email or SMS for any changes, cancellations, or reminders. Online booking systems simplify, automate, and expedite all processes not only for individual clients but also for big groups and businesses from customer details, payment method, booking, and up to reminders of the date of reservation.  

To put it briefly, Maslovska (2018) summarizes the online booking system as a modern and effortless booking process convenient for traveling and even in boosting sales with everything done digitally.

# Brief History and Current Situation of Online Booking System

Before the CRS or Computerized Reservation System development, many tourists depended on printed brochures, flyers, and listings in the local and regional travel guides. These methods of information dissemination were costly, labor-intense, and information remained static. In order to have a smooth and dynamic flow of information, CRS was created in the early 1960s by American Airlines to keep track of their sold seats. Since then, CRS has become the primary means of distributing air travel information. Cert und Robert E. Khan introduced the Internet Protocol in the early 1970s, which provides the travel agents direct CRS access via terminals. CRS then became a universal feature of the tourism industry. The emergence of GDS or Global Distribution System in 1978 allowed the traveler or travel agents to have a direct booking to a network system connecting to multiple vendors, including airlines, hotel rooms, car rentals, cruises rents, and activities.

**There are currently four major GDS systems:**

- Amadeus (1987) a leading global distribution system and technology provider that serves the marketing, sales, and distribution needs of the travel and tourism industries. 

- Galileo International (1993) provides global distribution services through computerized reservation systems, leading-edge products, and innovative internet-based solutions. 

- SABRE is the original computer reservation system and the creator of the advanced yield management system. Also, it is the leading travel website today. 

- WorldSpan (1990) offers the worldwide electronic distribution of travel inventory, internet products, connectivity, and e-commerce capabilities for travel agencies, travel providers, and corporations. 

**1994**
- With the emergence of the Internet and the formation of travel post on GDS, the Internet became available for the mass user, airlines, travel agents, and GDS providers became online. 

**1996**
- Travelocity.com is the first online travel agent that sells airplane tickets, destination information, hotel recommendation, and restaurants. 
- Microsoft launches Expedia that offers travel services on Microsoft Networks.

**2000**
- Priceline.com was founded, they offer discount flights.
- Major American carriers launch Hotwire. 

**2001-2004**
- Orbitz and KAYAK foundation are known as the number one flights and travel search engines. 

**2004**
- The emergence of Skyscanner, one of the biggest travel meta-search engines.

**2009**
- Introduction of mobile booking

**2011**
- Google launched its own flight booking platform, Google flights.

**2019**
- With the current state of online booking, online payment systems have become much more secure, have fast processing, and can even make transactions with crypto currencies. It allows travelers to plan a week long-trips in minutes, book flights, hotel rooms, and rent cars in just a few taps.

Today, the online booking system is widely used and has been growing in popularity at a very high pace as it makes the booking process faster and convenient. Before this system became available, some worked with a series of spreadsheets and entered the information manually through the old over-the-phone booking systems. Thus, it is time-consuming, prone to human error, and requires more staff members to keep track and manage bookings. As the business grows, it becomes more and more complicated and complex to manage and input the data manually in multiple documents.

With the advancement of technologies, many businesses are beginning to adopt online booking systems to automatically update and track processes, such as scheduling, payment, managing availability, and notification reminders to deliver a smooth booking experience to users and eliminate various possible risks associated with manual input and human error. Especially during the past season when the Covid-19 pandemic forced many people to switch nearly all the usual day-to-day tasks to an online platform. More and more people rely on online bookings as it is integrated into a website, app, or even on social media pages with simply the use of mobile devices and the Internet with ease rather than phone calls or emails. In addition, it allows users to access 24/7 from anywhere. Thus, it gives them the freedom to instantly see and check availability, reserve, and pay for their services online, whether home rentals, staycations, rideshares, etc., without waiting for the next day to make a booking or reservation. Indeed, the online booking system has become essential in today’s era. It is modernizing and constantly exploring new opportunities to evolve and become more reliable, efficient, user-friendly, and time-saving for both customers and employees.

# Why is Online Booking considered to be Disruptive?

One of the biggest reasons to why this technology is making waves causing disruption is due to the fact that consumers can book more diverse options from a wider pool of providers offering staycations in their homes or a rideshare with their own cars under easy to access platforms that suite their personal preferences in a cost effective and convienient manner compared to the traditional players of these industries leading to people gravitating towards the former. 

Also to add to that, these platforms are powered primarily by tech companies that focus on the booking application process and support itself while the providers handle the actual services which leads to a lot of flexibility, consumer empowerment and less cost to maintain for the tech platform in general allowing for these businesses to grow as they captialize on a customer bases that are willing to travel on a budget.

Another clear indication of the disruption is that the traditional players are properly starting to adapt this tech towards their business in multiple ways, either by working with the tech firms running these new platforms (operating taxi bookings on Grab etc.) or improving their own established systems (constant improvement of services from the Expedia Group and Booking Holdings, two of the biggest existing online bookers for traditional traveling) in order to compete in this new market landscape or to suffer irrelevancy as a result.

# What field/market is it disrupting?

New technologies have affected numerous industries within the past decade. Traditional hospitality businesses and travel agencies have transitioned to using new business models such as alternative accommodation like Airbnb and Housetrip, and ride-sharing applications like Uber. These new business models are derived from online booking systems and have been impacting customers’ and hospitality businesses alike.

In the digital age, we’ve put more importance on personalized services. This would mean that industries who can offer customised experiences become more relevant.

According to Angelo Rossini (Bearne, 2016), a contributing analyst at Euromonitor International, “Traditional travel distribution in which high street travel agencies played a dominant role was revolutionised with online travel agencies and direct distribution through airlines and hotels’ websites acquiring a key role.” Rossini adds that the rise of independent travel killed off tour operators and traditional travel agencies (Bearne, 2016). The disruption has affected both the **travel industry** and **hospitality industries** like **hotel and/or lodging** forcing them to adapt, thus introducing the online booking system.

Airbnb, as one of the biggest disruptor to the travel industry, gave rise to numerous similar online lodging companies. Within an ever-evolving space, this technology has given small businesses a platform, thus expanding the reach and accessibility of this phenomenon.

Consumer relations and hospitality have also been reshaped by technology. With an online booking system, communication and travel are made easy. Stephan Croix, the vice-president of marketing at Starwood Hotels and Resorts, owner of hotel chains W Hotels and Aloft, states that “it is also transforming every phase of hospitality – from finding a hotel, to checking in, to unlocking your door and personalising your stay. As travel is inherently mobile, travellers expect to use their mobile devices to enrich their travel experiences” (Bearne, 2016).

Through the use of online booking systems, these affected industries can provide more convenient processes and allow customers more control over their experience. Industries who use online booking systems will appeal to guests because they focus on giving them options about the commodities they want to see like choice accommodations or expected amenities. On the other hand, hoteliers and travel agencies use online booking systems to manage reservations, availability, billing and reporting. This allows owners to manage business operations efficiently.

Because of this, the customer journey is transforming. What’s next for these industries is to live up to client expectations and think of more ways to stay afloat.

# Alternatives

According to New York Curbed by Megan Barber, Airbnb is undeniably popular: Now in 100,000 cities, with seven million rental listings worldwide. At the same time, the company and its competitors have battled local zoning laws that prohibit short-term rentals and fought grassroots movements aiming to limit where and how short-term rental companies can operate. These are a helpful guide by Megan Barber to other options in the vacation rental market:

- Sonder https://www.sonder.com/ > Sounder offers a fully automated check-in process and provides high-speed WiFi, towels, in-suite laundry, and coffee in every rental.

Once a member has found a match, they can decide on an honor-based success fee of any amount that supports Sabbatical Homes and keeps the site advertisement-free.

- Vacasa https://www.vacasa.com/ > This Portland-based vacation rental company offers around 25,000 vacation homes around the world. Instead of relying on the home-sharing system, Vacasa curates the properties and pays over employees to clean and maintain them.

# Conclusion 

The productivity and efficiency benefits of online booking systems are obvious to most businesses in terms of increasing profits in booking appointments. We can only tell that these are disruptive to those industries or establishments that are not still adopting digital solutions. One of the main advantages of these is by allowing users to do bookings anytime, anywhere, and at their own convenience time 24/7. It can also save time and money costs by the manual ways of a company. Through online booking systems, the operations are fully automated.

With the innovations of digital technology, online booking made everything more comfortable, fast, convenient, and practical. Everything has its pros and cons though. As mentioned above, in some ways, it is disruptive. It's not like we can go back to the traditional ways though. Technically, we can. Still, we would never opt to do so. Technology is constantly upgrading and so are our ways. We would be left out by the world if we don't apply changes like how every other part of the world is doing so. The only option we have is to choose the best ones that are now available. In this case, which online booking system, despite its flaws and disruptiveness will benefit us the most? As time passes by, the current issues that we have with will most probably be resolved though there would be new ones.
