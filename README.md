# What is Disruptive Technology?

There are also online booking platforms that operates as an online marketplace. This means that the system does not own what are being sold on their platform but is accepting commissions from businesses posting their lodging services in to the platform. For example, Airbnb, it does not only operates for 1 or 2 hotels but is open to any home or room owner who accepts renting out their local homes for accommodation. Opening a booking online marketplace will be a threat to companies who have set up their own booking sytem solely for only their place or service. Locals who want to avail a place or service would prefer a booking marketplace since they will have more options rather than choosing from one company. 


# What is an online booking system and how does it work

An online booking system allows customers to appoint or reserve a service conveniently through digital platforms where they can browse the amenities and features of a service and pay in advance by online transfer. This process ensures a quick and secure way for clients to get the best service they need. It is also efficient for businesses as its system “updates all changes in information and schedule and reflects them in real-time so that both you and your customers see it” (Maslovska, 2018) while keeping necessary information private with security keys.

The most common services that utilize this system are property/room rentals, such as staycations and private resorts, and transportation services. This type of system then is used mostly by travelers and tourists as it is accessible, time-saving, and provides a smooth and easy transaction. A software platform for such usually has multiple listings posted so customers can check out the property/service, along with the price. Further, clients can determine how great or unsatisfactory the service has accommodated past customers through posted reviews, allowing them to choose and book excellent services of their choice. 

To put it briefly, Maslovska (2018) summarizes the online booking system as a modern and effortless booking process convenient for traveling and even in boosting sales with everything done digitally.


# Brief History and Current Situation of Online Booking System

Before the CRS or Computerized Reservation System development, many tourists depended on printed brochures, flyers, and listings in the local and regional travel guides. These methods of information dissemination were costly, labor-intense, and information remained static. In order to have a smooth and dynamic flow of information, CRS was created in the early 1960s by American Airlines to keep track of their sold seats. Since then, CRS has become the primary means of distributing air travel information. Cert und Robert E. Khan introduced the Internet Protocol in the early 1970s, which provides the travel agents direct CRS access via terminals. CRS then became a universal feature of the tourism industry. The emergence of GDS or Global Distribution System in 1978 allowed the traveler or travel agents to have a direct booking to a network system connecting to multiple vendors, including airlines, hotel rooms, car rentals, cruises rents, and activities.

**There are currently four major GDS systems:**

- Amadeus (1987) a leading global distribution system and technology provider that serves the marketing, sales, and distribution needs of the travel and tourism industries. 

- Galileo International (1993) provides global distribution services through computerized reservation systems, leading-edge products, and innovative internet-based solutions. 

- SABRE is the original computer reservation system and the creator of the advanced yield management system. Also, it is the leading travel website today. 

- WorldSpan (1990) offers the worldwide electronic distribution of travel inventory, internet products, connectivity, and e-commerce capabilities for travel agencies, travel providers, and corporations.

Today, the online booking system is widely used and has been growing in popularity at a very high pace as it makes the booking process faster and convenient. Before this system became available, some worked with a series of spreadsheets and entered the information manually through the old over-the-phone booking systems. Thus, it is time-consuming, prone to human error, and requires more staff members to keep track and manage bookings. As the business grows, it becomes more and more complicated and complex to manage and input the data manually in multiple documents.

With the advancement of technologies, many businesses are beginning to adopt online booking systems to automatically update and track processes, such as scheduling, payment, managing availability, and notification reminders to deliver a smooth booking experience to users and eliminate various possible risks associated with manual input and human error. Especially during the past season when the Covid-19 pandemic forced many people to switch nearly all the usual day-to-day tasks to an online platform. More and more people rely on online bookings as it is integrated into a website, app, or even on social media pages with simply the use of mobile devices and the Internet with ease rather than phone calls or emails. In addition, it allows users to access 24/7 from anywhere. Thus, it gives them the freedom to instantly see and check availability, reserve, and pay for their services online, whether home rentals, staycations, rideshares, etc., without waiting for the next day to make a booking or reservation. Indeed, the online booking system has become essential in today’s era. It is modernizing and constantly exploring new opportunities to evolve and become more reliable, efficient, user-friendly, and time-saving for both customers and employees.
